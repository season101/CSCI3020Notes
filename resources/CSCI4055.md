Canonical Forms

Reduce functional dependency.

# Question 1

**R(A, B, C, D, E, G)**, **F = {AB → C, C → A, BC → D, ACD → B, D → EG, BE → C, CG → BD, CE → AG}**. Reduce the functional dependency.

---

## Solution:


1. AB -> C and C -> A  ( Given )

2. AB -> A and A ->A  ( Transitivity and By Reflexibility )

So F = {AB->C, }
